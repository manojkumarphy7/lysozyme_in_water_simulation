# Lysozyme in Water Simulation

This folder contains the full setup and outputs from a GROMACS simulation of lysozyme solvated in a water box. The system was prepared by placing the protein inside a cubic periodic box, adding water molecules, and neutralizing the charge with counterions. The workflow includes energy minimization, NVT and NPT equilibration, and a production run.

## Folder Structure

input/
  Contains all coordinate, topology, and restraint files used to build the system. This includes the protein structure, solvated boxes, processed files, and topology information.

mdp/
  Holds the parameter files used for each stage of the simulation. These include minimization, ion addition, NVT, NPT, and production MD settings.

results/
  Stores all simulation outputs, such as energy files, logs, checkpoint files, trajectories, and final structures. It also includes directories containing data from minimization, equilibration, and production phases.

scripts/
  Reserved for any run scripts or helper scripts used to execute or manage the simulations.

## Simulation Summary

Lysozyme was prepared and simulated in a water environment to study its behavior under standard conditions. The system was minimized to remove close contacts, equilibrated to stabilize temperature and pressure, and then simulated under constant conditions using a 2 fs time step. Constraints were applied to hydrogen bonds to maintain numerical stability.

This dataset can be used as a reference for understanding protein dynamics, solvent interactions, and typical workflows used in biomolecular simulations.

## How to Use

* Review files in **input/** if you want to rebuild or modify the system.
* Check **mdp/** for parameter settings and adapt them for similar systems.
* Explore **results/** to analyze protein stability, energy profiles, and trajectory data.
* Add your own scripts to **scripts/** if you extend the workflow.

Feel free to adapt this structure for additional systems or future simulations.
